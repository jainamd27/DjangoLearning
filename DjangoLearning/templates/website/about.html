    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <pre>
        Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jainam Doshi, a passionate tech enthusiast and aspiring software engineer with a love for building smart solutions that make life better.
        
        Ever since I started exploring the world of programming, Iâ€™ve been fascinated by how technology can be both creative and logical. From crafting modern front-end designs using Tailwind CSS to developing intelligent AI chatbots and fine-tuning LLMs, I enjoy diving deep into new technologies and bringing ideas to life.
        

        ðŸ”§ What I do:
        
        Build intuitive web interfaces with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS
        
        Develop smart AI assistants using Python and API integrations
        
        Fine-tune language models and explore Machine Learning
        
        Create mini projects and prototypes to learn and grow every day
        

        ðŸ’¡ I believe in learning by doing, and Iâ€™ve worked on everything from AI-powered assistants to fun ML models, always aiming to understand how things work under the hood.
        
        Currently, I'm leveling up my backend skills with Django â€” and this very website is one of my hands-on projects! ðŸš€
        

        
        Letâ€™s connect, create, and build the future. Because why just use the tech, when you can create it? ðŸ˜Ž</pre>
